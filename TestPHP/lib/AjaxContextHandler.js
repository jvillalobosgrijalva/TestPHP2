/**
* Global Ajax Context Handler. This is simply a global class that keeps track of all ajax requests we've made and when told to, will loop through them to see if there are
* any that need to be taken care of. By housing all instances in a single spot, we  can simply tell this  class to CheckEvents and it will loop through its internal
* array of ajax objects to see which objects have have completed, yet haven't been handled. This way it doesn't care who actually STARTED this request, it will always
* fire the right handler for the right ajax object.
